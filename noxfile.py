"""Nox sessions for testing across all supported Python versions.

`poe test` runs the fast single-interpreter loop with coverage + HTML/XML artifacts
(the canonical run that feeds docs and badges). This matrix instead just asserts the
suite passes on every supported interpreter, so we clear pytest's heavy ``addopts``
(coverage/html/junit) from pyproject with ``-o addopts=`` to keep it lean.

This file is the single source of truth for which Python versions are supported; CI
reads the same set rather than duplicating it.
